## Background & Objectives
I needed to re-visit the concept of 'scraping' and parsing, so here I am re-doing some Ruby exercises.

## To run the program:

First, open your terminal and install the Nokogiri gem, like so:

```bash
gem install nokogiri
```

Then run the Ruby code by navigating inside the lib/ folger and running:

```bash
ruby scraper.rb
```

To change the city where the results will be scraped from change the parameters passed inside the scrape_craiglist_antiques method.

Have fun!
